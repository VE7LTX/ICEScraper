# Web Scraping Adventure

Welcome to our Web Scraping Adventure project, where we embark on a journey to explore the vast world of the internet, uncovering the hidden treasures of data and links!

## Overview

This project is a foray into the realm of web scraping, using Python to navigate through websites, extract valuable information, and store it for further analysis. It's like a digital treasure hunt, where each website is an uncharted island full of secrets to discover.

## Features

- **Dynamic Web Scraping**: Navigate through various websites and dynamically extract data.
- **Data Storage**: Efficiently store the discovered links in a SQLite database.
- **Error Logging**: Keep a record of any issues encountered during the scraping process.

## Tools Used

- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to websites.
- `BeautifulSoup`: For parsing HTML and extracting the needed data.
- `sqlite3`: For database creation and management.
- `urllib.parse`: For URL manipulation and validation.
- `os`: For interacting with the operating system.
- `logging`: For logging errors and important messages.
- `datetime`: For working with dates and times.

## How It Works

1. **URL Formatting**: Ensures the URLs are in the correct format for processing.
2. **Database Creation**: Generates a unique SQLite database file for storing the scraped URLs.
3. **Scraping Process**: Navigates through the given base URL, scraping and storing each discovered link.
4. **Link Exploration**: Continues the scraping process by visiting each new link found.

## Setup

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the script:

```bash
python web_scraping_adventure.py
Input the base URL when prompted to start the adventure!
```

## Logging
Errors and issues encountered during the scraping process are logged in scraping.log for review and debugging.

## Note
Web scraping should be done responsibly and ethically. Always check a website's robots.txt file and terms of service before scraping, and ensure your activities comply with legal regulations and respect the website's data.

## Conclusion
Join us in this thrilling adventure of web scraping, as we delve into the depths of the internet and bring back the hidden gems of data!

### Happy Scraping!
